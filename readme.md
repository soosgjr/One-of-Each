# One of Each

A Caves of Qud mod that greatly increases the likelihood of a merchant of each
kind spawning in the Stiltgrounds.


## Installation

Copy the `Source\OneOfEach` folder to the `Mods` folder of your Caves of Qud
installation. This is usually located under the
`%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Freehold Games\CavesOfQud` path. Once this is done, the
mod has to be enabled in the game's mod menu.


## Usage

The mod will override the first couple of tents in every zone when generating
the Stiltgrounds, which requires each zone to generate at least two of these.
This requirement is met most of the time, but isn't guaranteed, as the game can
occasionally still roll a large number of animal pens instead.

The overridden tents will spawn in the following zones:

- **South (Entrance)**: Vintner and beekeeper. Due to the limited amount of
  available space in this zone, these are the most likely to be missing.
- **Southwest**: Jeweler and apple farmer.
- **West**: Hatter and haberdasher.
- **Northwest**: Glover and shoemaker.
- **North**: Armorer and gutsmonger. The guaranteed vanilla gutsmonger was moved
  here from the southeast.
- **Northeast**: Gunsmith and grenadier.
- **East**: Bookbinder and schematics drafter.
- **Southeast**: Apothecary, ichor merchant, kipper, and chef. These are always
  guaranteed to spawn.
